### Day 1: 11.9.2019
#####
**Today's Progress**: 
Worked on Freecodecamp.org Responsive Web Design challenges, Basic HTML and HTML5 up to 18/28. 
Set up github for challenge and forked the repo. Started reading ProGit book to better understand Git. 

**Thoughts**: 
Not a bad day. It will be tough balancing all the other things in my life and doing this challenge and journaling about here but going to try.

**Music**: Mahler: Symphony No.2

### Day 2: 11.10.2019

**Today's Progress**:
Finished up Freecodecamp.org Basic Html adn HTML5 lessons. Hopefully will start CSS tomorrow. Started reading "Javascript: The Good Parts." It is an older book but a developer who I knew said even though it is outdated it is a good read. Might be a little above my head at this point, it is a short book and will try to get through it. Commented out the template for this log and added Music to the journal.

**Thoughts**:
Tried to get more reading and coding in but life, still got a fair bit in though. How the fuck did I not know Chelsea Wolfe existed?

**Music**:
Chelsea Wolfe - just a mix of her stuff.

### Day 3: 11.11.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Only was able to get 9 lessons on freecoadecamp.org done, wasn't feeling well. Also not much in the way of reading either.

**Thoughts**:
Progress is much easier when you do not have work or feel like crap

**Music**: Chelsea Wolfe, again

### Day 4: 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Did the freecodecamp.org thang for a bit and am in the process of registering a Wordpress site to practice HTML, CSS, Javascript, and journal about this whole thing

**Thoughts**:
Finding time is hard if you are looking to sit for large ammounts of time but breaking it down to what is manageable blocks of time as chaos ensues is easier. That is not to say that I would not like to sit and code for a few hours straight.

**Music**: SURVIVE just a random assortment of stuff

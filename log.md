### Day 1: 11.9.2019
#####
**Today's Progress**: 
Worked on Freecodecamp.org Responsive Web Design challenges, Basic HTML and HTML5 up to 18/28. 
Set up github for challenge and forked the repo. Started reading ProGit book to better understand Git. 

**Thoughts**: 
Not a bad day. It will be tough balancing all the other things in my life and doing this challenge and journaling about here but going to try.

### Day 2: 11.10.2019

**Today's Progress**:
Finished up Freecodecamp.org Basic Html adn HTML5 lessons. Hopefully will start CSS tomorrow. Started reading "Javascript: The Good Parts." It is an older book but a developer who I knew said even though it is outdated it is a good read. Might be a little above my head at this point, it is a short book and will try to get through it. Commented out the template for this log and added Music to the journal.

**Thoughts**:
Tried to get more reading and coding in but life, still got a fair bit in though. How the fuck did I not know Chelsea Wolfe existed?

**Music**:
Chelsea Wolfe - just a mix of her stuff. https://open.spotify.com/artist/6ZK2nrW8aCTg8Bid7I7N10?si=0i76260OR8ipWeAn5aL5tA

### Day 3: 11.11.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Only was able to get 9 lessons on freecoadecamp.org done, wasn't feeling well. Also not much in the way of reading either.

**Thoughts**:
Progress is much easier when you do not have work or feel like crap

**Music**: Chelsea Wolfe, again https://open.spotify.com/artist/6ZK2nrW8aCTg8Bid7I7N10?si=0i76260OR8ipWeAn5aL5tA

### Day 4: 11.12.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Did the freecodecamp.org thang for a bit and am in the process of registering a Wordpress site to practice HTML, CSS, Javascript, and journal about this whole thing

**Thoughts**:
Finding time is hard if you are looking to sit for large ammounts of time but breaking it down to what is manageable blocks of time as chaos ensues is easier. That is not to say that I would not like to sit and code for a few hours straight.

**Music**: SURVIVE just a random assortment of stuff https://open.spotify.com/artist/12cKwxUl6Ku3VpSB3LjrM5?si=2x25pDExTFiOEEvwHWEQLw

### Day 5: 11.14.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**:
Missed yesterday due to life so doubled down today. Did some reading. Did a bunch on freecodecamp.org. Also been trying to break the habit o glancing at my keyboard when typing so I can pay attention more to screen. I have been trying to break that habit for years and have made a ton of progress but consciously doing it is even harder.

**Thoughts**:
Regret not getting anything done yesterday but between work, family life, and my Wednesday violin lessons it was to much.

**Music**:
Spotify daily mix that was kinda badass with The Decemberists, Ted Leo, PJ Harvey, and other assorted indie goodies! https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E37gQB18jvV8I?si=HAllMvk-TKqP87G0PPLLng

### Day 6: 11.15.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Just did an hour today. Just freecodecamp. Nothing fancy but feel good about the progress I am making. I am not rushing it just soaking it in at this point. I am hopefully *fingers crossed* going to get to sit down and get a bunch done this weekend

**Thoughts**:
Had a bad panic attack last night and did not get to sleep till 2:30am. Plus side about working from home is that I have not gotten out of my pajamas and got be a scumbag all day.

**Music**: Spotify mix of some great pop punk RVIVR, Signals Midwest, Iron Chic, Dilllenger Four, The Mezingers... https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E37gQB18jvV8I?si=ZUIeLNzGT0qXnKROIz5qJg

### Day 7: 11.16.2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Slow going today. I was hoping to get more time in but life and feelings got in the way. Did some coding but not much.

**Thoughts**:
PBR, Whiskey, and Whiteclaw lubricate the mind.

**Music**:
Standard coder loops https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E37QyHhRPf20w?si=Uq357GFERdK-Fu6lrWZyrQ

### Day 8: 11.17.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Got to do a bunch of lessons considering I had a lot of things going on.

**Thoughts**:
People are pretty awful on the internet. I sometimes forget that

**Music**:
Just another lo-fi mix from spotify https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E37QyHhRPf20w?si=NkYt_-QPRc6yZJvSycpsRQ

### Day 1 round 2: 12.9.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
I'm back! Took a 14-day break between work and the Thanksgiving. I have not been idle. I made it to the Responsive Web Design Projects, which is actual coding. I have made it this far before. I could not dissect everything that I did before, so I am recreating the same tribute page I made before I have successfully added the key elements while satisfying the requirements first. That gives me a framework to work with. I can then make the design around that. Yesterday I started to tackle this, but it was frustrating since I was jumping in the middle of the old page and trying to fit it into the new requirements. I needed a place to start so starting with the requirements and then adding elements of the old page helped. It meets the bare minimum, so it is not ready to submit but it should be soon.

**Thoughts**:
Having a starting point and a plan, albeit a chaotic one that forms as I go, helps.

**Music**:
Chillwave and hard seltzer https://open.spotify.com/playlist/79aRSPbBPfYUUSQlNVHwit?si=8S6blnKiQRCGppIL8Yb9PQ

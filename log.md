**Today's Progress**: 
Worked on Freecodecamp.org Responsive Web Design challenges, Basic HTML and HTML5 up to 18/28. 
Set up github for challenge and forked the repo. Started reading ProGit book to better understand Git. 

**Thoughts**: 
Not a bad day. It will be tough balancing all the other things in my life and doing this challenge and journaling about here but going to try.

**Music**: Mahler: Symphony No.2

### Day 2: 11.10.2019

**Today's Progress**:
Finished up Freecodecamp.org Basic Html adn HTML5 lessons. Hopefully will start CSS tomorrow. Started reading "Javascript: The Good Parts." It is an older book but a developer who I knew said even though it is outdated it is a good read. Might be a little above my head at this point, it is a short book and will try to get through it. Commented out the template for this log and added Music to the journal.

**Thoughts**:
Tried to get more reading and coding in but life, still got a fair bit in though. How the fuck did I not know Chelsea Wolfe existed?

**Music**:
Chelsea Wolfe - just a mix of her stuff.

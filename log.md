### Day 1: 11.9.2019
#####
**Today's Progress**: 
Worked on Freecodecamp.org Responsive Web Design challenges, Basic HTML and HTML5 up to 18/28. 
Set up github for challenge and forked the repo. Started reading ProGit book to better understand Git. 

**Thoughts**: 
Not a bad day. It will be tough balancing all the other things in my life and doing this challenge and journaling about here but going to try.

### Day 2: 11.10.2019

**Today's Progress**:
Finished up Freecodecamp.org Basic Html adn HTML5 lessons. Hopefully will start CSS tomorrow. Started reading "Javascript: The Good Parts." It is an older book but a developer who I knew said even though it is outdated it is a good read. Might be a little above my head at this point, it is a short book and will try to get through it. Commented out the template for this log and added Music to the journal.

**Thoughts**:
Tried to get more reading and coding in but life, still got a fair bit in though. How the fuck did I not know Chelsea Wolfe existed?

**Music**:
Chelsea Wolfe - just a mix of her stuff. https://open.spotify.com/artist/6ZK2nrW8aCTg8Bid7I7N10?si=0i76260OR8ipWeAn5aL5tA

### Day 3: 11.11.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Only was able to get 9 lessons on freecoadecamp.org done, wasn't feeling well. Also not much in the way of reading either.

**Thoughts**:
Progress is much easier when you do not have work or feel like crap

**Music**: Chelsea Wolfe, again https://open.spotify.com/artist/6ZK2nrW8aCTg8Bid7I7N10?si=0i76260OR8ipWeAn5aL5tA

### Day 4: 11.12.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Did the freecodecamp.org thang for a bit and am in the process of registering a Wordpress site to practice HTML, CSS, Javascript, and journal about this whole thing

**Thoughts**:
Finding time is hard if you are looking to sit for large ammounts of time but breaking it down to what is manageable blocks of time as chaos ensues is easier. That is not to say that I would not like to sit and code for a few hours straight.

### Day 5: 11.14.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**:
Missed yesterday due to life so doubled down today. Did some reading. Did a bunch on freecodecamp.org. Also been trying to break the habit o glancing at my keyboard when typing so I can pay attention more to screen. I have been trying to break that habit for years and have made a ton of progress but consciously doing it is even harder.

**Thoughts**:
Regret not getting anything done yesterday but between work, family life, and my Wednesday violin lessons it was to much.

**Music**:
Spotify daily mix that was kinda badass with The Decemberists, Ted Leo, PJ Harvey, and other assorted indie goodies! https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E37gQB18jvV8I?si=HAllMvk-TKqP87G0PPLLng

### Day 6: 11.15.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Just did an hour today. Just freecodecamp. Nothing fancy but feel good about the progress I am making. I am not rushing it just soaking it in at this point. I am hopefully *fingers crossed* going to get to sit down and get a bunch done this weekend

**Thoughts**:
Had a bad panic attack last night and did not get to sleep till 2:30am. Plus side about working from home is that I have not gotten out of my pajamas and got be a scumbag all day.

**Music**: Spotify mix of some great pop punk RVIVR, Signals Midwest, Iron Chic, Dilllenger Four, The Mezingers... https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E37gQB18jvV8I?si=ZUIeLNzGT0qXnKROIz5qJg

### Day 7: 11.16.2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Slow going today. I was hoping to get more time in but life and feelings got in the way. Did some coding but not much.

**Thoughts**:
PBR, Whiskey, and Whiteclaw lubricate the mind.

**Music**:

### Day 8: 11.17.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Got to do a bunch of lessons considering I had a lot of things going on.

**Thoughts**:
People are pretty awful on the internet. I sometimes forget that

**Music**:
Just another lo-fi mix from spotify https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E37QyHhRPf20w?si=NkYt_-QPRc6yZJvSycpsRQ

### Day 1 round 2: 12.9.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
I'm back! Took a 14-day break between work and the Thanksgiving. I have not been idle. I made it to the Responsive Web Design Projects, which is actual coding. I have made it this far before. I could not dissect everything that I did before, so I am recreating the same tribute page I made before I have successfully added the key elements while satisfying the requirements first. That gives me a framework to work with. I can then make the design around that. Yesterday I started to tackle this, but it was frustrating since I was jumping in the middle of the old page and trying to fit it into the new requirements. I needed a place to start so starting with the requirements and then adding elements of the old page helped. It meets the bare minimum, so it is not ready to submit but it should be soon.

**Thoughts**:
Having a starting point and a plan, albeit a chaotic one that forms as I go, helps.

**Music**:

### Day 2: 12.10.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Started to make the tribute page look not so Geocities( look it up), yes I just dated myself. Mostly by adding CSS elements and starting to use ID’s. Was a pretty good day.

**Thoughts**:
Would love to add some shadows and perspective and then I might be done.

**Music**: Synthwave for the win! https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3gWAZPuNWpELIhKNbnpfwk?si=gFGtwz2uQRWyUhnmezIHOg

### Day 3: 12.11.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Finished the tribute page, as much as I want to at this time. I will go back and add and clean it up but it looks aesthetically pleasing. On to the Survey Form.

**Thoughts**:
Getting the page up is the easy part starting it and getting it to look good is the hard part.

**Music**: Microtonal contemporary, micortoanl classical, and classical https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E36OE87lDUXbu?si=PtUN17YdTsu-WNbhGGnNYA

### Day 4: 12.12.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked on the Survey Project (Link Below) at FreeCode Camp. Was fun and am starting to get into a flow with the projects and how to tackle them

**Thoughts**:
When tackling these projects, for argument sake I will say the Tribute Page or the Survey Form( Since I finished the one and am starting the other) I like to go down the list of the user stories and just create base code with nothing else to fulfill the test requirements? I would say template but I am doing it by hand at this point( I see it as practice).

Once the requirements have been met and it will pass the tests. I start filling in what the project will be. As I am just finding and writing the code to fill those requirements I start thinking about what the project will be about. Then I use Trello and SublimeTect to take notes, search the internet for the color palette to use, and images.

I find it helpful to understand my rules(I originally said limitations but that was not the right word or way to look at it) and work from there and build it around those. It is how I approach work as a system analyst, especially implementation projects where I am the technical asset. I learned that from learning about Bach’s Goldberg( No relation to the wrestler) Variations.

### Day 5: 12.13.2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Progress was slow. Less coding and more research/reading on how I want to do this. Going to try a new approach.

**Thoughts**:
Switching things up. Sure it will be fine

### Day 6: 12.14.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Made some real progress. Not just on the Survey form but in coding as well I have been actively looking up more on how to apply and the reasons for using the HTML I am using.

**Thoughts**:
So just writing the code on the fly I am learning more code. It is making me research more about what I am using and why. I think as I get better I will go back to a more structured approach but for now, let chaos REIGN!

**Today's Progress**: 
Coded today, just coded. Nothing exciting.

**Thoughts**:
Today just happened did my hour+.

### Day 8: 12.16.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Mostly finished the HTML portion, I am sure I will look tomorrow and find something else. Now onto CSS, fonts, and color palette.

**Thoughts**:
Today was rough. I almost did not code. The child was terrible, work was exhausting( for a lot of resons that will became apparent soon, fingers crossed), and HTML is not what I am super interested in but I am interested enough to push through to the good stuff that I want to learn.

**Music**: Two playlists today...

### Day 9: 12.17.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Did not get any coding done today but started picking out colors, font and reading about CSS Specificity.

**Thoughts**:
None

**Music**: Did not even get a chance to listen to music

### Day 10: 12.18.2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
Started building the CSS side of the survey page. Taking me a bit since I am looking over element as I lay it out. I am learning a lot this way though but it is taking forever!

**Thoughts**:
Actually looking up the more advance CSS elemets that I am using for the survey is time consuming but worth it in the long run. Still need to go back and fix my tribute page.

**Music**: If you like to get lost in strange disonant electronic and Classical this mught be your jam https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E39tqbQUxVqW8?si=Xd2IHQv3QOyGInmkzYOBhw
